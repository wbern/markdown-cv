<h2 id="education">Education</h2>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2006-2009</code></p>

<p><strong>Upper Secondary High School (Gymnasium), <a href="https://www.ntigymnasiet.se/kronhus/">NTI-Gymnasiet</a></strong></p>

<p>Entering this education helped me find mentoring teachers to further formalize and identify my weaknesses and strengths in the tech world. Seeking more life experience, I actually continued to pursue programming and IT mostly on my free time and not professionally. It would take a few years before I started developing for people other than myself, which was ironically what I ended up loving the most.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">June 1989 - now</code></p>

<p><strong>Self-taught tech and applied tech enthusiast</strong></p>

<p>I am proud to say that I am mostly self-taught. Most of my hard-earned lessons come from personal projects like online multiplayer games, chat bots, server-, media- and home-automation systems.</p>

<h2 id="nominations">Nominations</h2>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Presidential Award nomination, Hewlett Packard Enterprise</code>
The Salesforce ‚ÄúImprover‚Äù tool I developed for this employer received this nomination. Project is listed under ‚ÄúInteresting projects‚Äù further down.</p>

<h2 id="interesting-projects">Interesting projects</h2>

<h4 id="2021-now-podcast-co-creator"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2021-Now, Podcast co-creator</code></h4>

<p>As a nice distraction to talk about things outside our immediate work area, me and Henrik St√•hl discuss various topics on how to strengthen a company and teams, applying various work methods and philosophies, like programming in groups instead of solo programming.</p>

<p>The podcast has given me a good opportunity to reflect on what is actually worth something outside my personal ‚Äúcompany bubble‚Äù.</p>

<h4 id="2018-now-time-to-market--developer-experience-frontend-monorepo"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2018-Now, Time to market / Developer experience: Frontend Monorepo</code></h4>

<p>For the frontend within B2B, we adopted Rushjs (Lerna prior), and Web Components, in order to create <a href="https://micro-frontends.org/">micro-frontends</a> that are easy to maintain, and more future-proof than other fast-moving targets.</p>

<p><em>Two</em> key principles throughout this time was to streamline as much of the architectural principles as possible (we categorized our micro-frontends by <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Atomic Design</a>), as well as to create tools that gave developers the ability to create new micro-frontends in under 30 seconds, using code generators and quick-start guides.</p>

<p><strong>Since 2021, this project helped influence the company enough to create a united monorepo for B2B and B2C business areas</strong>, where developers are now enjoying increased productivity, more supporting developer tools, and a tried-and-true shared infrastructure. Finally many developers get a more intuitive entry to the ever-growing complexity of frontend-development, that I have witnessed during my time of starting up teams, writing documentation and collaborating on tool- and frontend development.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2016-2017, Chrome Extension: Salesforce "Improver"</code></p>

<p>After a CRM change, and noticing a very tough transition for the company users, I developed a minimal chrome extension for my employer that could improve the user experience, letting employees more easily handle administrative tasks, see items stock, and more. Interest grew fast, and the tool ended up having several hundreds of users before leaving the company. I made sure to set up proper feedback loops with an on-premise chat client (Mattermost), a proper version control system (Gitlab on-premise), a continous integration / continous delivery platform (Gitlab CI), and a proper project board for stakeholders to follow the development of features.</p>

<p>As of 2019, it now boasts 5000 active users, who all voluntarily sought it out and installed it.</p>

<p>The project has been given a very prestigious company-wide award nomination, and has influenced Salesforce, a Fortune 500 company, to add in first class support for tweaking their CRM, for example by <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/lwc">leading the change to supporting the Web Components spec. in browsers</a>.</p>

<p>It was after this project that I felt ready to commit to the idea to drive change through company culture and community movements, via servant leadership and genuine dedication to user experience, whether that user is a company employee or an end customer.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2012-2015, DevOps engineer for community server</code></p>

<p>Managed a VoIP server with 175~ active users during peak hours. I wrote plenty of automated bots that assisted visitors throughout this project.</p>

<p>This community project helped me to keep a keener edge with linux as a server as well as with managing rented virtual machines. I also learned more about bot development, focusing on modularity between features.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2013-2015, IT incident monitoring system for hallway monitors</code></p>

<p>Monitoring system that centralized incoming tickets from various legacy services using web crawlers and computer macros.</p>

<p>The value brought was increased responsiveness amongst the office workers in critical customer emergencies.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2010, Skype Bot</code></p>

<p>Before it became easier to have ‚Äúrooms‚Äù for voice-communication online in Skype and other services, I created a bot with the purpose of hosting calls, inviting users into the call when someone wrote to the bot. The project was written in C# using Skype‚Äôs SDK.</p>

<p>This was a very useful feature for me and other collaborators at the time, as we were moving to the Skype platform for day-to-day work, and perhaps one of my first ‚ÄúDeveloper experience‚Äù-focused tools written.</p>

<h2 id="occupation">Occupation</h2>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2021-Now, Lead Developer for B2B, Telia Company AB (Sweden)</code></p>

<p>Leading team startups, having multi-team onboarding sessions, contributing to architectural short-term tactics and long-term strategies, as well as acting as a bridge to various departments within the organization, and sometimes in other organizations.</p>

<p>My main goal at all times is to make myself redundant over time for teams, giving them the space needed to grow product aware, and find their own working dynamics.</p>

<p>This is the first job where I‚Äôve been able to experiment with things like mob programming job interviews, test-driven development cultures, and a high focus on customer experience as well as developer experience. Most people probably know me as this guy who comes in to have fun at work with the team, and get the job done well at the end of the day. If a team I‚Äôve started feel that way most of the time, I‚Äôll be happily moving on to the next team until I‚Äôm needed again.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2020-2021, Senior Frontend Developer, Telia Company AB (Sweden)</code></p>

<p>Telia had the need to break down the monolith and go for micro-service architecture (as well as micro-frontend architecture in the frontend), I contributed to this by working in multiple teams on how to move towards solving the difficult task of going micro-services.</p>

<p>After a short period of focusing on enabling a wide range of teams and spreading general goodness, I was moved into a lead position for a business area that I was previously working in as a consultant.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2017-2020, Frontend developer consultant, KITS AB</code></p>

<p>Different short-term and long-term job assignments, ranging from React to vanilla Javascript and VueJs.</p>

<p>Throughout this time period I managed to broaden my skill set as a developer and as a team contributor. It also gave me a lot of hands-on experience about different architectural needs from different types of customers.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2015-2016, + Team Lead, Hewlett Packard Enterprise</code></p>

<p>My gathered domain knowledge and previously proven leadership skills landed me in leading a team of 10. This was my first formal leadership position given to me at age 25. A few of my first actions were to ensure a better routine around team psychological safety by establishing routine team meetings, encouraging ad-hoc discussions and caring for my team.</p>

<p>It was not uncommon for me to be in a technical discussion in the morning and in a team-lead oriented discussion in the afternoon, and to this day I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been able to beat those feedback loops as a developer.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2011-2015, Service Coordinater &amp; Tech person, Hewlett Packard Enterprise</code></p>

<p>I started this role as a coordinator surrounded by people to work together with to solve critical customer incidents in server environments, but quickly grew into a technically responsible person at my working site. A lot of the self-taught programming I had done since teenage years came into full fruition during these years as I helped develop a dozen productivity tools and various metrics systems to ensure well-met KPI‚Äôs and overall quality.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2011, On-site engineer @ Aloq IT</code></p>

<p>Small IT company that offered services to a car sales company, as well as a few other companies. My job was mostly to support the owner with various tasks like taking customer calls and helping customers with technical issues on-site.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2008-2011, Indie Programmer (partly collaborative)</code></p>

<p>Mostly game development, part fun part entrepreneurial. Somewhere along the way I realized that I much more enjoyed tool- and game engine development rather than making a game with a storyline. Looking back, it was definitely a fun ride with the community I was in.</p>
